# Code Quiz Challenge
## Description
This code quiz presents the player with five basic coding
questions. They have 60 seconds, but lose 15 seconds for each wrong answer provided. Their final score is how much time they have remaining (with a minimum of 0).

On completion, players will be able to enter their initials which will be saved locally and displayed on the highscore table. From there, they can clear all saved scores or start the quiz again.
